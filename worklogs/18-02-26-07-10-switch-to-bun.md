# Switch project tooling to Bun

**Agent**: GPT-5.2 (Codex CLI)
**Session**: 18-02-26 07:10 - 07:20 (approx)

## What was done
- Migrated from `package-lock.json` to Bun lockfile (`bun.lock`) and switched the repo to Bun as the package manager.
- Added Vercel commands to ensure deploys install/build using Bun.
- Verified `bun run lint`, `bun run test`, and `bun run build` pass locally.

## Files changed
- `package.json` - Added `packageManager: bun@1.3.9`.
- `vercel.json` - Set `installCommand` to `bun install` and `buildCommand` to `bun run build`.
- `package-lock.json` - Removed (Bun lockfile used instead).
- `bun.lock` - Added (generated by `bun install`).

## Decisions made
- Added `vercel.json` to avoid Vercel auto-detect ambiguity and force Bun for installs/builds.

## Issues encountered
- None.

## Next steps
- Keep future dependency changes via `bun add` / `bun install` so `bun.lock` stays authoritative.
